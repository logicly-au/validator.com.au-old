<p>The <a href="https://webval.validator.com.au/">MDS Validator</a> is an extensible, web-based application for determining the validity of large data sets. It ensures that large data sets passed between <em>submitters</em> and <em>receivers</em> are valid and consistent, according to a set of rules. These rules ensure that data is</p>
<ol>
<li>Formatted correctly, as per a specification;</li>
<li>Internally consistent (that is, the data appears to be logical and coherent).</li>
</ol>
<p>The value of the MDS Validator is that very large data sets – such as health records – can be efficiently and effectively examined for validity prior to acceptance.</p>
<p>This reduces errors, lowers costs, and improves the accuracy and effectiveness of subsequent reporting and decision making.</p>
<p>The MDS Validator is developed and operated by <a href="http://www.strategicdata.com.au/" target="_top">Strategic Data Pty Ltd</a> under contract to the <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/" target="_top">Department of Health</a>, in support of data sets sponsored by the Department. Its current users include the <a href="http://www.aihw.gov.au/" target="_top">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare</a> (AIHW) and the <a href="http://amhocn.org/" target="_top">Australian Mental Health Outcomes and Classification Network</a> (AMHOCN).</p>    <div id='last-modified' class='pull-right'>
